# sinatra-documentation

An extension for a Sinatra application that allows your routes to automatically return
help documentation by specifying a route with a '.readme' extension
(ie. '/users/show.readme') and rendering the matched '.md' file.

**NOTE** This is still under development. It works, but will make API changes as it gets
more flushed out.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'sinatra-documentation'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sinatra-documentation
